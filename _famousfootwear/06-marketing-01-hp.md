Our Homepage has a max content width of 1280px. This max size is determined by the max width of our site frame (header/navigation & footer). Currently, the homepage scales at a multiple of 1.35. In order to account for this, our typography and links need to increase in size so that they maintain their readability when scaled down to 980px. Below, is a stylguide strictly for Homepage stories that accounts for the scale. 

### Typography

### Hero Story
A “Hero Story” is the first story we present on the Famous Footwear Homepage. It is meant to be the most impactful story, which is why it has a greater height than secondary stories.

Text placement and image placement can vary and is the designers prerogative, as long as the typography and spacing guidelines are followed.

**Sizing**

- Width: 1280px
- Height: 600px

A “Secondary Story” is the name given for all sroties that follow the main Hero Story. These Stories should have alternating color backgrounds (alternating white bg, with color bg), with the Hero Story dictating the start of the pattern.

Text placement and image placement can vary and is the designers prerogative, as long as the typography and spacing guidelines are followed.
