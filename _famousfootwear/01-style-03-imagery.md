Our photography is broken out into two different buckets, site and marketing. Both are shot in a complenting style of the other to create a cohesive visual experience.

##Product Photography
All photography for the results pages and product details pages are resized using an image API. This gives us flexibility to choose which of our 7 views to display, how big we want the product image, and how close we crop the image. 

It is important that while we can crop to the nearest pixel of the product, we cannot change the background from white. This means that all product must be displayed with that in mind.

[Learn more about the image API >](http://imageresizing.net/docs/reference)

###Results Page
For the results pages, we currently display the side view of the shoe. This helps us to create a consistent baseline for our product photos. Otherwise much taller shoes, such as boots, would look out of place next to smaller profile shoes, like canvas or athletics.

Below are examples of shoes with different heights but a common baseline.

###Details Page
On the details page for each product, the user has the ability to choose between one of 7 views. Each of these views can be altered by the image API, and used in different web or native applications.

## Marketing Photography
Unlike product photography, photography for marketing assets are tailored to the message being shared with the customer. These photos are shot primarily in-house, and are masked and retouched by the in-house photography team.  

### ALL full color
All product photography should appear in full color. Use in combination with black and white lifestyle photography to enhance emotional connection. No backgrounds. Strong sunny lighting and crisp shadows.

### Lifestyle
Lifestyle photography comes in three forms: user generated (UGC), Photo Booth and environmental photography (shot every season).

### All Black & White
All lifestyle photos show interactions with 2 or more people (preferably 3 or more). B/W lifestyle can be used in conjunction with full color product shots.

### UGC
User Generated Content (UGC) are photos submitted by customers of Famous Footwear. These photos are currently being displayed on the #ohsofamous gallery. This content has also been used in marketing messaging (emails and banners).

### Photo Booth
Close-ups with no backgrounds. Single shot or series depending on space. White borders with subtle drop shadows.
