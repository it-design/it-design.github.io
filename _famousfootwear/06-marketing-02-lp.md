Landing pages are content pages that have less of a focus on shopping.

### Getting Started
To begin a project install and run the Photoshop action **12 Column Grid**. This action will build your document to the right starting specs, layout your guides into the 12-column grid and add a visual grid layer to toggle on and off as needed.

### Margins for Copy Blocks

To help maintain consistency and increase readability copy blocks shouldn’t span more than 8 columns in the 12-column grid. There should be 20px between Headlines and 30px between Body copy and links.

### Hero Story/Image

Hero image is full width and scales to screen size. File for the Hero image size must be 1600 x 700 px in order to scale properly. Ideally we would layer HTML text over the image but it is not a requirement. The text can be a part of the image itself.

### Story Navigation

This is a full-width bar that ‘sticks’ to the top of the page when it’s scrolled to that position. The content/links stay within the area of 960px. This is currently a desktop only feature. The navigation is set in a 2-column layout spanning the 12-column grid. The ‘title’ area is on the left and the story links on the right. Gutter between Story links should be at least 20px.

#### Navigation/Initial State 

- No background color
- 1px #CBCBCB bottom border spanning 980 px
