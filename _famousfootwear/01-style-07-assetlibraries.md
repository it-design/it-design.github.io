The Asset Library contains reusable elements to help maintain consistancy and increase speed in file creation and to help take the guess work out of locating assets. All elements are approved final components that you can pull into your documents. Below is more detailed information on how to utilize these resources.

###Adobe CC Asset Library
The Adobe CC Library contains the assets needed to quickly create your marketing messaging (i.e. emails, banners, ads, etc.). To receive access to this library, email the username of your Adobe CC account to [Joe Ebeler](mailto:jebeler@caleres.com?Subject=Asset Library Access Request).

**NOTE: You must have an Adobe CC account to be able to use the asset library**

To use the Asset Libraries, choose one of the five libraries *Styles, Graphic Assets, UI, Templates, Iconography* from the dropdown option in the *Libraries* window.

![Library Menu](../../../assets/famousfootwear/images/style-asset-libraries-menu.png "Library Menu")

To use an asset from the library, right click on any asset from the “Libraries” window and select *Place Layers*. This will place the layered asset into your document. All the assets in these libraries can be opened by double clicking on them. By doing so you are editing the libray asset and any changes made to this asset will be shared for all users. Please try not to edit final library assets unless you have been given the proper approval.

<span class="label label-warning">WARNING: Make sure you 'Place Layers’ so you do not overwrite the styles in the Asset Libraries.</span>

To change Type Styles, select your ‘Text Layer' (do not highlight your text with the text tool) and click the style within the library.

###Photoshop Actions
A couple Actions have been created to help speed up workflow and to make it easier to utilize the elements within the Asset Libraries. 

####Email Campaigns
The email campaign document action will build out your campaign document for you so you have a clean palette to work from. Once the action is finished you can easily edit the necessary text and place the necessary email templates into your document.

####12-Column Grid
A similar action has been created for landing pages. This action builds your page to the correct size and adds the 12-column grid. Again this gives a clean consistant starting point for your projects and reduces the time you would spend building each page one your own.
