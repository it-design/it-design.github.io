The Famous Footwear font library, see below, is used primarily as a web font for the desktop and mobile site. Each icon has their corresponding css code listed below them. Icons with a code of “n/a” are icons that have yet to be added to the live font library.

## IcoMoon
IcoMoon is the web app used to compile the Famous Footwear icons into a usable font library for the web. Unfortunately IconMoon saves library information locally. This means that designers/developers must load the most recent library, a JSON file, to their local IcoMoon web app. Luckily, we keep this file up to date.


## Pay with PayPal
For the “Pay with PayPal” button, the PayPal logo was broken up into two separate SVG files (to maintain brand integrity).
