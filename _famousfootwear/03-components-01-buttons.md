# {{ page.title }}
**All call to actions should speak specifically to the intended outcome.** For Example: For a story highlighting sport sandals, the CTA should read along the lines of, “Shop Sport Sandals.” In this instance, the user knows that they will be taken to a page curated with exclusively sport sandals. As apposed to simply saying “Shop Now” which could mean that the link might go to a specific product details page, or a results page. The Goal is to create as much clarity and ease of use for the user as possible.  

Famous Footwear has three primary button/link styles that span between mobile and desktop layouts. All button styles share the following properties:

- 40px in height
- 5px border radius
- White call to action copy on a colored background
- CTA text size: 18px

### Primary Action
For primary, or eCommerce focussed, actions such as “Add to Cart”, “Proceed to Checkout”, or “Checkout”, the red gradient button is used. Since red is such an attention grabbing color, it is best used only when necessary to maintain the user’s focus when it comes to shopping.

### Secondary Action
Secondary actions are content driven actions tied to marketing ads, forms, and other UI needs. All in all the blue background gradient is used with an arrow added when the user is going to a different page.

### Text Links
Text links can be used in body copy, or as de-emphasized call to actions for smaller (marketing) stories.
