##UI Color
In instances where UI messaging is required to grab the user’s attention, we use the following colors. When we can, we stay away from using the Famous Red as an alert color since it is already part of the core color palette and might confuse users.

####Examples
Examples of these colors in the wild can be seen with the cart page’s store availability feature and cart UI in the desktop header.

#Gradient Application
To match the strong lighting aesthetic seen with the product photography, and to create some tactile dimension to the digital experience, gradients are used in specific cases. The gradient Famous Header is used primarily for the header on the desktop and mobile site (see below). The Primary Action and Secondary Action gradients are used for giving depth to primary and secondary action buttons. Check out the Buttons page to learn when these buttons are used.

Below are the gradients and their steps.
