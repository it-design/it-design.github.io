Input fields share a similar format as buttons in order to maintain consistency throughout the experience. For Famous Footwearâ€™s needs, there are two kinds of inputs: text fields and drop downs.


### Text Fields
Text fields continue the lighting structure seen in cards where each field shows an inset shadow to highlight an area for the user to interact with.

### CSS

{% highlight css %}
height: 38px;
background: #FFFFFF;
border: 1px solid #E6E6E6;
box-shadow: inset 0px 5px 1px 0px #FBFBFB;
border-radius: 5px;
{% endhighlight %}

The field name is always displayed above the input field and is smaller (14px) than the copy inside the text field (16px) to make it easier for the user to see what they are inputting.

Below is an example of a filled out text field.

### Drop Downs
Drop downs share a similar styling to text field, except for the location of the inset shadow. To emphasize a tappable interaction for touch devices, the inset shadow is located at the bottom of the field.
